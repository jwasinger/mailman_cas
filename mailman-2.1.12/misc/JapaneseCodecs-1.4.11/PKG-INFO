Description: This package provides Unicode codecs that make Python aware
        of Japanese character encodings such as EUC-JP, Shift_JIS and
        ISO-2022-JP.  By using this package, Japanese characters can be
        treated as a character string instead of a byte sequence.
Platform: anywhere Python runs
